The Raven
Deep into that darkness peering,
Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
Dou2ting, dreaming dreams no mortals
Ever dared to dream 2efore;
But the silence was un2roken,
And the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken
Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
This I whispered, and an echo
Murmured 2ack the word, "Lenore!"
Merely this, and nothing more.
